### Chat & Minutes / Agenda bashing

## Agenda

### SVCB records with CoAP (ML, CA)

Presented slides: https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/interim-2024-core-07/materials/slides-interim-2024-core-07-sessa-dns-service-binding-records-with-coap-01.pdf

ML presenting about DNS Service Bindings with CoAP.

ML: Summary of how these related documents have become more related.

ML: The problem is that only CoAP over TLS has a registered ALPN ID.

ML: Now CoAP over DTLS needs an ALPN ID, which has been allocated, however the experts asked for an Internet Draft. A number of open problems exist. draft-ietf-dns-over-coap is introducing 'docpath' as a parameter to indicate the URI path of a DoC server.

ML: The rest of the material is placed in draft-lenders-core-dnr. However we now have a chain of references/dependencies which is complicated.

ML (p9-19): Showing what is planned to be taken out of the original draft-lenders-core-dnr to be instead in future versions of it, or in draft-ietf-core-transport-indication or in the not-published-yet draft-lenders-core-coap-dtls-svcb. The discovery of CoAP transport is now in draft-ietf-core-transport-indication. The registration of the ALPN ID for DTLS is planned to be in draft-lenders-core-coap-dtls-svcb.

ML: As early noticed, -coap-dtls-svcb would be a normative reference for -dns-over-coap.

ML: The building of CoAP messages from an SVCB record better fits in -core-transport-indication. Would this make the latter a normative reference for -dns-over-coap? Can we phrase things to make it just informative instead? Can we get away with not talking at all about construction of CoAP requests from SVCB in -dns-over-coap ?

ML: The overall question is what is needed to be normatively referenced, especially from -dns-over-coap. How should we proceed?

MT: We should work on filling the table below to get things structured.

MT: Regarding the registration of the ALPN ID, the goal would be to have it in coap-dtls-svcb, right? Is that feasible now that core-dnr is the draft referred to in the IANA registry?
ML: That was only added later. We'd have to check with Christian who took these actions.

ML: Question for Christian: The registration of the ALPN ID refers to the DNR draft now. Is it ok?
CA: It happened as a consequence of publishing the draft. After we move the IANA registration section to a different document, we can tell IANA and have them change the reference. It is like when we split or merge documents.
MT: When we get there, it would be great to have the reference including the draft version number (related to an ongoing discussion in SAAG about referring to Internet Drafts in IANA registries).


**Whiteboard**

Discussions to fill the table below, under the dashed line.

CA: Who should we ask to about if they are planning the generalization on building request messages from SVCB? We can try with one of the authors or the group.
ML: Maybe the authors of SVCB.

MT: Would draft-lenders-core-dnr refer to draft-ietf-core-transport-indication?
ML: Since we want to have core-dnr as a problem statement for now, the ALPN ID for DTLS is not a problem. Does it make sense to specify the DTLS ALPN ID in -core-transport-indication?
CA: The progress of -core-transport-indication is expected to be a bit slower.
ML: If we only informatively refer to it from -dns-over-coap, it can show an example using the 'docpath' parameter.
CA: We would be normatively referencing the IANA registry on a record introduced by a draft.
ML: We do not need to say that it is only specified for CoAP over TLS.
CA: It is implying "if you find something else useful in ALPN, use that too?"
ML: Do we need to say how to construct the request from an SVCB at all? DNS-op managed to not do that.
MT: It does not hurt to give an example, if it is just an example.
CA: Wherever we mention the building of CoAP messages from CBOR, we should at least say that it is a work-in-progress generalization (e.g., in -core-transport-indication).

MT: If we move the DTLS ALPN ID registration to -core-transport-indication, that would result in not having a batteries-included DoC to ship anytime soon.
ML: There is already a lot of things missing for a "batteries-included DoC" anyway. We do not have OSCORE, nor different defined transfers for CoAP. Can we use CoAP over TLS as an example for now?
MT: A preferred choice should be CoAP over DTLS, as that is the original way CoAP thought of when using security; DTLS should be in the batteries instead of TLS. Otherwise you are forcing the use of TLS for the sake of an example.
ML: So making the reference to draft-lenders-core-coap-dtls-svcb normative can make sense.
MT: With draft-lenders-core-coap-dtls-svcb providing the DTLS ALPN ID registration.

CA: A normative reference from draft-ietf-core-dns-over-coap to draft-lenders-core-coap-dtls-svcb makes sense. We can aim for back-to-back publication of these -- it is just not one document for one small reason (since it is more general than for -dns-over-coap), otherwise it would be the single document -dns-over-coap covering the DTLS ALPN ID too.

MT: In the latest version of draft-ietf-core-dns-over-coap, you mention exploring the problem space in draft-lenders-core-dnr. Is the plan to keep that after removing the DTLS ALPN ID from draft-lenders-core-dnr?
ML: The document also explores DDR/DNR and CoAP service binding discovery with OSCORE.
MT: So the plan is to keep an informative reference?
ML: Informative from -core-dnr to -dns-over-coap.

CA: The feeling is that there will be two solutions: one for ACE and one for EDHOC.
MT: Do you expect a hard split of those into two different documents?
CA: For now, we have a problem statement document, so there is nothing to split yet. I hope to interest LAKE contributors to jump in (as authors or contributors).

MT: So no reference from draft-ietf-core-dns-over-coap to draft-lenders-core-dnr?
CA: It makes sense to have it.
ML: We are aiming to reduce references, so I am not sure that we want that.
CA: What is the purpose of reducing the amount of informative references?
MT: I do not see an issue with informative references, we just have to be careful with the normative ones.

ML: The informative reference in draft-lenders-core-dnr to draft-ietf-core-dns-over-coap is needed, that is the main use case.

MT: I noticed a relevant mail that just came in, suggesting alternative names for "docpath" in PR #28 of -dns-over-coap, i.e., "coappath" or "coapath".
CA: We will come back to it. There is no reason to keep it short.
MT: Do you not want "docpath" since it is a path to a DoC server?
CA: Yes, but we can discuss that with the experts when we ask: "Did you think about how to build URIs?" They say `dohpath`. Could they have said "httppath"? "dnspath"? "path"? (The latter two would be problematic because a \_dns service indicating both a "co" and "h2" would alias two unrelated resources).
ML: In DoH, the "dohpath" is chosen more because it is a URI template.
CA: I think that "coappath" makes sense, but that should be checked.
ML: But what you get is actually a Service B record.
CA: You know anyway what kind of services you have asked for. So no need to have "dns" spelled out in the parameter name.
MT: Then "path" is always sufficient?
CA: No, because two pieces of information are included. There is "d" (DNS) which is probably redundant with the prior knowledge that "this is a SVCB record for the \_dns service", and the "c"/"h" which should stay separate because coap://host/path is not necessarily an alias for https://host/path.

MT: Are you happy with the plan in the table?
CA: I am.
MT: Of course, I hope that the work in draft-lenders-core-dnr can continue, although it is less urgent.
CA: A lot of things on EDHOC in draft-lenders-core-dnr will be picked up for the Onion-style addresses to consider in draft-amsuess-t2trg-onion-coap

MT: Could ML or CA send an email to the CoRE mailing list with the content in the table as plan? If no one objects, you can go ahead and update the documents according to that plan.
CA: Should we even wait?
MT: Better to give the opportunity for more people to comment if they wish too.
ML: I will send it.

MT: draft-lenders-core-coap-dtls-svcb can be put in a fast track. Do you still see it as Standards Track, after moving away the content on CoAP request building to -core-transport-indication?
CA: We will have a normative pointer from draft-ietf-core-dns-over-coap. I do not object about making it Informational, but then we will have to argue about the downref in -dns-over-coap.
MT: What DoC needs is the registered value for the DTLS ALPN ID, right?
CA: Maybe Informational can work if -dns-over-coap just says "then use CoAP over DTLS using the ALPN from -coap-dtls-svcb" and refer to it informatively.
MT: The reference is definitely normative. Let's think of -coap-dtls-svcb as Standards Track for now and we can get back to it later.

### AOB

MT: No interim meeting is scheduled in two weeks, also due to the IoT security hackathon at INRIA Paris.

MT: The next interim meeting is on June 5th; I expect to have a conflict, but Carsten and/or Jaime will take it.
