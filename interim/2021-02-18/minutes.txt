## Agenda

### Note Well

Remember that the [note well](https://datatracker.ietf.org/submit/note-well/) applies, for [IPR](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp79) but also for [WG processes](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp25) and [code of conduct](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp54). Try to be nice.

Rikard Presenting slides

Problem early raised at the IETF 109 meeting; related to too many usages of a same key in OSCORE, beyond which the security would break.

You need to count the number of key usage, separately:
* 'q': use for encryptions with the Sender Key
* 'v': failed decryptions with the Recipient Key

A CFRG draft gives formula to compute the limits, for AES-CCM and other algorithms (now an adopted draft)

 - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-aead-limits/

To compute the actual limits, one also needs to assume exact value for two attack probabilities, p_q and p_v; for now, the same values considered in DTLS 1.3 are considered.

From this, limits for 'q' and 'v' to use in OSCORE can be computed for the MTI algorithm AES-CCM-16-64-128.

GS: something on this is considered also in LAKE; the assumptions on the two probabilites are pretty arbitrary.

MT: more for coordination among CoRE and LAKE

Discussing open points.

CA: on regularly storing 'q' like in OSCORE Appendix B.1, check also if the two parties can help each other so that only q-half can be stored.

MT: Most of responses don't consume a Sender Sequence Number, but still the server uses its Sender Key to encrypt the response.

CA: But a request has at most one non-notification response associated. That can practically make you store less.

MT: if the limits are really something "related to the algorithm" (rather than to OSCORE), they can be part of the algorithm registration; something possibly for COSE (like the deterministicity feature).

Safe to NOT increment 'v' if the message is discarded as a replay? Christian and Göran agree it is safe.

Next steps: new document soon submitted to CoRE defining the limits, how to track them and what to do with what you have today.

GS: People in LAKE may help nailing down the right numbers to consider.

CA: DTLS has an 8-byte tag value, it has up to 2^7 failed decryptions if the same MTI algorithm of OSCORE is used.

### AOB

MT: interim meetings will resume on the second half of April, meaning six interim meetings before IETF 111; plan to move back to every other Wednesdays at 16:00 CET / 16:00 CEST (same time of today), as it used to be. No objections from attendees.

CB: Plan to handle the agenda conflict at IETF 110?

MT: All security-related topics will be on Monday, to avoid the conflict with DANISH on Friday. Even so, agenda simulations suggest that all fits.

CB: Can you ping Ivo about the COMI document requiring a revision?

MT: Yes, will do.

CA: now processing last items on the Resource Directory about 'anchor' and frehsness; good to have a look at those from Esko and Göran respectively. Plan to submit a revision before the cut-off.
